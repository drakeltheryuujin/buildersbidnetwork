<h1>Questions About Subscribing</h1>
    <h3>Do I need to have an account to use BBN?<h3>
      <p>BBN allows unregistered users to browse limited versions of the company profiles and projects posted on the site. In order to see complete project listings, post a project or bid on an existing project, you must sign up for an account, either as a Developer[LINK] or Contractor[LINK].</p>
    <h3>What account types are available on BBN?/How much does it cost to subscribe to BBN?</h3>
      <p>There are two types of accounts on BBN - Developer accounts and Contractor accounts.</p>
      <p>Developer subscriptions are free, but do not allow bidding on projects. Contractor subscriptions cost a nominal $XX per year and allow bidding on projects.</p>
    <h3>How do I register for BBN?<h3>
      <p>If you are a Developer[LINK] follow this link to the Developer Registration page. If you are a Contractor[LINK] follow this link to the Contractor Registration page.</p>
      <p>After you're registered, you'll receive an email from BBN asking you to activate your account. Then you're ready to set up a profile and jump into the central marketplace of the building industry.</p>
    <h3>[IS THIS ACCURATE?]Can I contact companies I have seen on BBN to request work on posted projects or on future projects?</h3>  
      <p>Part of the BBN Terms of Service[LINK] require that our members contact each other through the website for all posted projects. If, through the course of business, members develop a professional relationship such that a developer chooses to directly contract with a contractor rather than engaging in a bidding process, then that falls outside the BBN purview.</p>
      <p>I didn't receive my BBN account confirmation email.</p>
      <p>You can request that another confirmation email be sent to you.</p>

    <h3>I have two accounts that need to be merged, how do I do that?</h3>
      <p>We do not currently have a way for two pre-existing companies to merge into a single account.

        <ol>
          <li>Sign in to your account.</li>
          <li>Search for the company you would like to add through the Search function at the top of your profile page</li>
          <li>Click through to that company's profile.</li>

        </ol> 
    <h3>What is Ignore and how does it work?[SAME AS ABOVE. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT OUR IGNORE FUNCTIONALITY]</h3>
      <p>If there is a user who you don't wish to be able to send messages to you through BBN or who you don't wish to be able to bid on projects you post, you can ignore them. The "Ignore" link is located under the user's profile picture on their company profile page. Clicking the Ignore link will take you to a list of people you are currently ignoring. Use the "go back" link or simply hit the back button on your browser to return to the larger EPS site.</p>
      <p>If you choose to ignore another member, they will no longer be able to send you messages through EPS or bid on your projects. The link, "Stop Ignoring" will appear under their profile picture, giving you the option to remove the ignore block whenever you want.</p>
    <h3>How do I know an email is from BBN?</h3>

  <h2>Questions About Creating a Project</h2>
    <h3>How do I create a new project?</h3>
      <p>Developer accounts can create new projects for bidding. To do so, you: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sign in to your account.</li>
          <li>From your Homepage/Profile page, click the Post a Project link in the upper right corner of the page.</li>
          <li>Fill out the information on the Post a Project page.</li>
          <li>Click the Save and Continue button at the bottom.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>Only invite bidders when you are sure the project description is complete.</p>
      <p>Tip: By setting the Open for Bidding date later than you are actually planning to open bidding, then saving your changes, you can come back to the project to make further edits before it is visible to bidders.</p>  
    <h3>Can I create a project, but wait to activate/post it?</h3>
      <p>You can create a project, but post it later by selecting a later Open for Bidding date in the Project Timeline section of the Post a Project screen. Any Open for Bidding date can be selected, even years later, allowing you to activate the posting at any time you choose by later editing the project and adjusting the Open for Bidding date to the desired date/time. However, once a project is Open for Bidding, you can only Cancel the project or put it On Hold, not make it "inactive" again.</p>
    <h3>How do I invite specific contractors to bid on a project?</h3>
      <p>After a project has been posted, you can invite specific contractors to bid on it either by individually inviting them from their profile pages with the Invite to Bid link at the right of their company name, or you can invite a group of them by:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the project page.</li>
          <li>In the bottom right corner there is a list of Other Contractors in Project Area.</li>
          <li>Click the Invite to Bid link next to each contractor you'd like to add.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Can I limit the contractors bidding on a project?</h3>
      <p>You can disallow individual contractors from bidding on your project by:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sign in to your account.</li>
          <li>Go to the contractor's profile page.</li>
          <li>Under the contractor's profile image, click the Ignore button.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>This will prevent the contractor from bidding on your projects in the future. </p>
      <p>It is impossible to limit contractors able to view a project to only a handful as it is advantageous for more contractors to bid on a project. The BBN mission is to improve the marketplace for contractors and developers by making it centralized and inclusive. </p>
    <h3>Can I invite additional contractors once a project has been posted?</h3>
      <p>Once you have posted a project, you can invite additional contractors to bid on that project either  with the Invite to Bid function on their company's profile page or by:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the project page.</li>
          <li>In the bottom right corner there is a list of Other Contractors in Project Area.</li>
          <li>Click the Invite to Bid link next to each contractor you'd like to add.</li>
        </ol>
     <p>This feature allows you to invite additional contractors to bid until the end of the bid submission period.</p>
   <h3>How do I select a winning bidder?[IS ANY OF THIS ACCURATE?]</h3>
     <p>After a project's bid submission period has ended, you can select the winning bidder by:</p> 
      <ol>
          <li>Sign in to your account.</li>
          <li>In the upper right corner of the page, click on the Track My Projects link.</li>
          <li>Select the project you want to award from the list.</li>
          <li>Go to the Bids tab.</li>
          <li>Click the Select Winning Bidder button [OR Check the box under the winning bidder and click the Make This the Winning Bid button].</li>
      </ol>
      <p>BBN will also send you an email to let you know when the bid submission period on a project is over, which contains a link directly to the Bids listing for the project, so that you can easily select a winner.</p>  
    <h3>How long do I have after the end of the bid period before I select a winning bidder?</h3>
      <p>After the bid submission period is over, you have XX[30?] days to select a winning bidder. BBN will also send you an email to let you know when the bid submission period is over, which contains a link directly to the Bids listing for the project, so that you can easily select a winner.</p> 
    <h3>Can I delay a project once it's been posted if the project status changes?</h3>
      <p>You can change the status of a project to "On Hold" by:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the project page.</li>
          <li>Click the Edit button.</li>
          <li>In the Project Timeline section, check the box marked "This Project is On Hold."</li>
          <li>Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>Please only put a project on hold if there is some expectation that it will be reactivated in the next 12 months. You can later go back into the project description and change the bid submission period using the normal calendar. If a project is unlikely to be reactivated within the next 12 months, instead consider Cancelling the project.</p>
    <h3>How do I cancel a project once it has been posted?</h3>
      <p>If a project must be cancelled for any reason, you can do so by:</p> 
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the project page.</li>
          <li>In the Project Timeline section, click the Cancel Project button.</li>
          <li>You will then be prompted to confirm that you want to cancel the project.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Can I purchase credits for contractors so that they can bid on a project for free?</h3>
      <p>You can purchase credits for a Contractor with a Developer account. From the Buy Credits page:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Check the Assign These Credits to a Third-Party Contractor box.</li>
          <li>When you do this, a list of local contractors will appear and you will also have the option to search for a contractor.</li>
          <li>Highlight the contractor for whom you would like to purchase the credits. [OR To purchase credits for a particular contractor, highlight their name.]</li>
          <li>When finalizing your purchase, you will be asked to confirm your contractor choice.</li>
        </ol>
  <h2>Questions About Bidding on a Project</h2>
    <h3>What are credits?</h3>
      <p>Credits are the default currency of BBN and are used by Contractors to make bid submissions. Credits can be purchased individually or in lots of XX, XX or XX. A single credit costs $XX. Bulk purchases of credits receive a per-credit discount.</p> 
    <h3>What are project tiers and how do they relate to credits?</h3>
      <p>Each project is placed into a particular credit tier based on the project owner's estimated budget for the project. These tiers are: </p>
      <p>Tier 1: XX-XX</p>
      <p>Tier 2: XX-XX</p>
      <p>Tier 3: XX-XX</p>
      <p>Tier 4: XX-XX</p>
      <p>Tier 5: XX-XX</p>
      <p>For contractors to submit a bid for a project in a particular tier, they must spend a number of credits proportionate to the value of the project tier. XX credits for Tier 1 projects, XX credits for Tier 2 projects, XX credits for Tier 3 projects, XX credits for Tier 4 projects and XX credits for Tier 5 projects. This ensures that the cost for submitting a bid is related to the actual value of the project being bid upon rather than an arbitrary flat rate.</p> 
    <h3>How do I buy credits?</h3>
      </p>To buy credits:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sign in to your account.</li>
          <li>In the upper right corner of any page, click on the Buy Credits link.</li>
          <li>Select whether you wish to buy a single credit or a block of credits.</li>
          <li>Enter your payment information.</li>
        </ol> 
    <h3>Do I need to buy credits all at once?</h3>
      <p>New EPS users may wish to purchase credits only when they want to bid on a project until they have a better sense of the number of credits they will need for a particular time period such as quarterly or annually. Credits can be purchased at any time.</p> 
    <h3>Can I be refunded for credits I have already purchased if I cancel my membership?</h3>
      <p>If you deactivate your membership, any credits belonging to your company's account are put on hold along with the rest of your profile information. BBN can not refund the cash value of purchased credits once they are purchased, so it is most useful to bid on projects before deactivating your account if you have extra credits in your bank. </p<>
    <h3>How do I bid on a project?</h3>
      <p>To bid on a project:</p>
        <ol>

        </ol>
    <h3>Can I save a draft of my bid proposal or do I have to enter all the information at once?<h3>
      <p>You may store a draft of your bid submission on the site, allowing you to work on a bid in multiple sessions[BY DOING A THING]. When you are finished with the bid submission, simply click the Submit Bid button at the bottom of the Create a Bid page. You can also fill in a bid submission with information from a previous bid, by [DOING A THING].</p>
    <h3>Can I change my bid proposal once I have submitted it?</h3>
      <p>You are free to change your bid proposal once it has been submitted as long as it is before the submission deadline by: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Sign into your account.</li>
          <li>From your homepage/profile page click the Track My Bids link in the upper right corner.</li>

          <li>When you have made your desired changes, click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>OR</h3>
      <p>Once a bid has been submitted you can not go back and make changes, even if it is before the end of the submission period. Make sure that you have made any changes to your bid draft before you submit it.</p>
  <h2>Questions About the Project/Bidding Process<h2> 
    <h3>When is a winning bidder selected?</h3>
      <p>A winning bidder is selected XX[30?] days after the bid submission period ends. Individual project owners may announce a winning bidder before the XX day period ends at their discretion. </p>
    <h3>What happens if a project owner fails to select a winning bidder?</h3>
      <p>If a project owner fails completely to select a winning bidder for a project, BBN refunds credits spent on the bidding process to the bidders. We also contact the project owner to see why no bidder was selected as a winner.<p>
    <h3>What happens if a project is canceled after bidding has begun/bids have been submitted?</h3>
      <p>If a project owner cancels a project, BBN refunds credits spent on the bidding process to the bidders.</p>
    <h3>What happens if a project is put on hold after bidding has begun/bids have been submitted?</h3>
      <p>If a project owner places a project On Hold, no new bids can be submitted for the project. Bids can be prepared for the project and saved on BBN, but will not be able to be finalized until the project is no longer On Hold. Bids that have already been submitted are saved in their current format. When the project is reactivated, they can be edited as per normal. If a project that is On Hold is Canceled by the project owner, credits spent on bid submissions will be refunded to the bidder as for any other canceled project.</p>  
    <h3>What happens if a project owner fails to pay a bidder?</h3>
      <p>BBN is a central marketplace for projects and contractors in the building industry. Failure to pay on the part of a project owner is outside of the purview of this site and we accept no liability for such a failure of payment.</p>
